      "Sure! I'm taking 50mg of sertraline which is a fairly low dose. I started out at 25mg, they increased me to 50mg and I started seeing improvements. I started on medication and decided to stick with it because I wanted to pass my semester. I had previously dropped out of school and I really wanted to finish my degree. I experience a lot of classroom anxiety so I would avoid going to class. On the sertraline, boom, anxiety in the classroom gone. It took me about 3 months to get to that point - so give your medication time to work.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had no weight gain on the medication at all. In fact, it has probably helped my eating habits because I used to binge eat when I was very depressed. I have since stopped doing that. \n",
      "\n",
      "The side effects I do experience are issues acheiving orgasm. Possible TMI but last time I attempted an orgasm it took me 45 minutes! I still experience sexual satisfaction with my partner but I have just accepted that it will be more difficult for me now. I also experienced mild nausea when I first started taking the pills but that went away within a week. \n",
      "\n",

      "Some antidepressants do have that side effect, because what you have to realize is the way they work is they \"balance\" out and change the levels of hormones and neurochemicals in our bodies. Citalopram specifically increases serotonin which surprisingly enough is a neurotransmitter inhibitor that calms and relaxes the brain. Which is possibly one of the reasons. \n",
      "\n",
      "My best suggestion for you is to speak with you psychiatrist or whoever is prescribing you the medications, and bring it up. There's a possibility if the citalopram is working and it keep your depression in check, your psychiatrist might be able to prescribe you a secondary med for days when you expect to have some form of romantic or intimate contact with you and your significant other.\n",

      "This is what folks with ED do with viagra. They only take it when they need it.

      "That being said, it is a perfectly good med. AFAIK research hasn't shown it to be any better or any worse than other antidepressants. I own quite a few psychopharmacology books and one of them says that virtually all antidepressants have a 68% response rate (in other words, 2 out of 3 people who take it will respond in some way). I also recall reading about something called \"the rule of thirds\": this refers to how in clinical studies for a particular antidepressant, the pattern tends to be that 1/3 of patients will go into partial remission (i.e., they are almost completely better but have residual symptoms), 1/3 will go into full remission, and 1/3 will not show any response.\n",
      "\n",
      "Celexa (citalopram) is a very commonly used antidepressant. It's an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor), which is a safe and pretty effective class of meds. SSRIs are commonly used because they don't cause side effects as much or as severely as other types of antidepressants like tricyclics (TCAs) or monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).\n",
      "\n",
      "If you'd like to read more about Celexa, I would recommend looking at this site: http://cdn.neiglobal.com/content/pg/live/citalopram.pdf\n",

      "That site has the same info that is in the book my doctor uses for prescribing info (it's called Stahl's Essential Psychopharmacology: The Prescriber's Guide). It explains what it's used for, how it works, notable side effects, how it causes side effects, what to do about side effects, best augmenting agents, dosing, best/worse candidates for taking this med, etc.\n",

      "This has not been said here, and I feel like it really needs to be.  Most anti-depressants will not make you less depressed. Period.  Finding one that works is difficult.  Some of the positive effects can be placebo or just your life circumstances changing.  They take 6-8 weeks to work with each medication.  It is normal to go through 2 or 3 before finding one that works for you and doesn't have nasty side effects.  From the first appointment until you find something you like might be 5-6 months.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I feel like you have this idea in your head that by getting anti-depressants your depression will go away, but that's not really how it works at all.  That being said, find a decent therapist or psychiatrist.  Sadly, in my experience, good ones are expensive.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, your parents sound like they have no idea how anti-depressants actually work or what they do.  Do some of your own research.  The things that make you feel nothing are maybe anti-psychotics or like xanax (I don't actually know as much about those drug categories) and they are different from an anti-depressant.  \n",

      "\n",
      "&gt; In short I want to die. That's it really. I just want to stop living. Not because I'm depressed from sadness, but because I'm tired. I'm only 19 years old and I feel like I'm 80. In high school teachers, counselors, etc. always use to ask my peers and I where we saw ourselves in ten years. I never knew the answer. I still don't. I can't picture my life in 10 years, or 5 years, or even next year. I hope I'm dead. Earlier I said I'm not depressed. That's not entirely true. Let me explain. I don't want to do anything with my life. The thought of going to college and having a career saddens me. Even the thought of having a simple job saddens me. The thought of interacting with strangers frightens me. The thought of living saddens me. I'm scum. I have the possibility to do anything with my life, and I don't have a hard life. My parent's didn't hit me. They didn't divorce. I have wonderful brothers and sisters, and yet I still feel this way. If I had the opportunity to not exist and somehow give my position to somebody who has had a hard life and suffered to them I would because at least they'd do something with it. I'd do it in a heartbeat. This is what depresses me. I am the definition of scum. I shouldn't be depressed, but I am. I don't feel like I deserve to be depressed but I am. And I hate myself even more because I am. I hold a small grudge towards my parents for bringing me into this world. I often find myself at night wishing they never met. Wishing I was never born. The thought of me not existing brings me such joy. But sadly I exist so the next best thing is death. And I would of killed myself by now but the thought of pain stops me. I'm too scared. Death is the only thing I want in life and once again the only person stopping me is me. I'm my own worst enemy. Sometimes I wonder if that's why I wanna kill myself. If somehow by committing suicide, I have killed the person who's made me feel the way I feel. I haven't told anyone the way I feel. No friends or family. I often joke to my friends about suicide but I'm positive they think I'm joking and have no idea how badly I want to die. This one time my friend casually told me at a party that he was kind of depressed, and he was describing exactly how I felt, and what did I do? I basically told him to shut up because no one wanted to hear that. I don't know why I told him that. I wonder if it was because he described my feelings and I felt like I couldn't accept it at the time. I regret it everyday of my life. It's another reason why I hate myself. My friend didn't commit suicide, and we've hung out since then, but he's never talked about it again and I haven't asked him. I'm not even good enough to be his friend. I've never felt connected to my family. At least not enough to ever tell them my feelings. I feel like my brothers and sisters were made for each other, if that makes sense. Like when you learn that they're related you think \"yeah, that makes sense\" but me, not so much. I'm nothing like them. We don't like the same things, and our personalities are so different that when we get together, like at a family gathering, I find that I don't talk to them much. and when we do they generally ask how's it going and I just say \"fine\". I've felt so lonely my entire life. Ever since I was a child. I've never had a girlfriend and at this point I don't even want one because I'm worried if I start dating someone and I tell her how I feel that she'll feel like she now has to stay in the relationship so I don't commit suicide. I often day dream of hanging out with this chick I had a crush on in one of my high school classes. We both love reggae music and we'd listen to it in class every now and then. I kind of gave signals that I was interested, but she never did anything. When I was attending community college she had the professor I had before me, and we'd talk for a few minutes. The first couple times was just catching up cause we didn't see each other for a while, and after that it was just me asking what we did in class. Now that I've dropped out of college I still think about her. I've even had dreams about her where we were just hanging out. I don't think that's healthy. I think I love her, but at the same time I just think I feel this way because I feel shitty. But when I dream of her I don't hurt so bad. But I'm just her friend, and I think I'm ok with that but it still hurts because she'll never know how I feel, but at the same time I know she doesn't feel the same. At this point I feel like I'm carrying a heavy weight and it just gets heavier and heavier. But I keep carrying it, and I want to drop it. But somehow I put a smile on my face, not because I'm happy but because the thought of losing this weight makes me laugh and the thought of me killing myself makes me laugh, because I know I'll carry it forever and I know I won't ever have the balls to kill myself, so I feel I'll always feel this way, but who knows. To me death sounds good all the time so maybe when I'm at my breaking point I'll do it. I have a lot more to say, but at this point I can't really think of a reason to keep going.\n",

      "The reason why hotlines are the norm is that a lot of friends and family, even if they have all the love in the world, just aren't emotionally equipped to deal with our thoughts of suicide.  So I think you're being wise and realistic to put some thought into how you present this to your family.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I also answer a hotline IRL and one of the things we end up doing quite often is helping people figure out how to break things to their families.  We also always help people work out a \"Plan B\" for what to do if telling the family doesn't go well.  So talking to your local or national hotline first might be an option for you if you feel comfortable with that.\n",

      "Either way, I think we might be able to help you more here in framing the conversation if you could tell us a bit more about yourself and your family, how long you've been feeling this way, and what your relationship's been like up to this point.  \n",
