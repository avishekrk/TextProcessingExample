    "# Text Analysis (Adapted from Garren Gaut's 2016 Tutorial)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Text Analysis is used for summarizing or getting useful information out of a large amount of  unstructured text stored in documents. This opens up the oppurtunity of using text data alongside more conventional data sources (e.g, surveys and administrative data). The goal of text analysis is to take a large corpus of complex and unstructured text data and extract important and meaningful messages in a comprehensible meaningful way. \n",
    "\n",
    "Text Analysis can help with the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Searches and informationa retrieval**: Help find relevant information in large databases such as a systematic literature review. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Clustering and text categorization**: Techniques like topic modelling modeling can summarize a large corpus of text by finding the most important phrases. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Text Summarization**: Create category-sensitive text summaries of a large corpus of text. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Machine Translation**: Translate from one language to another. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we are going to analyze reddit posts from May 2015 in order to classify whocj subreddit a post origniated from and also do topic modelling to categorize posts. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Glossary of Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Tokenize**: Tokenization is the process by which text is sepearated into meaningful terms or phrases. For instance, separating sentences using punctuation. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stemming**: Stemming is a type of text normalization where words that have different forms but their essential meaning are normalized to the original dictionary form of a word. For example \"go,\" \"went,\" and \"goes\" all stem from the lemma \"go.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* **TFIDF**: TFIDF (Term frequency-inverse document frequency) is an example of feature enginnering where the most important words are extracted by taking account their frequency in documents and the entire corpus of documents as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Topic Modelling**: Topic modeling is an unsupervised learning method where groups of co-occuring words are clustered into topics. Typically, the words in a a cluster should be related and make sense (e.g, boat, ship, captain). Individual documents will then fall into multiple topics. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **LDA**: LDA (latent Dirichlet allocation) is a type of probabilistic model commonly used for topic modelling. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stop Words**: Stop words are words that have little semantic meaning like prepositions, articles and common nouns. They can often be ingnored. \n",

this is my little way of venting and hopefully making myself feel better sort of my way of telling the whole world how i feel but not necessarily anyone will read it if that makes sense well it does to me the best way to describe it is that i prefer to have it here on reddit with the possibility of someone reading it than on microsoft word where i know no one will read it i m also typing what i feel none of this is planned so if it seems all over the place this is why like i said i just wrote this in attempt to make myself feel better i m tired and it s     am as im writing this so that explains any grammatical errors feel free to leave responses i don t care if i m breaking any rules i d greatly appreciate a pm mods so i can edit it or if i have to copy it so i can post it somewhere else anyway gt in short i want to die that s it really i just want to stop living not because i m depressed from sadness but because i m tired i m only   years old and i feel like i m   in high school teachers counselors etc always use to ask my peers and i where we saw ourselves in ten years i never knew the answer i still don t i can t picture my life in   years or   years or even next year i hope i m dead earlier i said i m not depressed that s not entirely true let me explain i don t want to do anything with my life the thought of going to college and having a career saddens me even the thought of having a simple job saddens me the thought of interacting with strangers frightens me the thought of living saddens me i m scum i have the possibility to do anything with my life and i don t have a hard life my parent s didn t hit me they didn t divorce i have wonderful brothers and sisters and yet i still feel this way if i had the opportunity to not exist and somehow give my position to somebody who has had a hard life and suffered to them i would because at least they d do something with it i d do it in a heartbeat this is what depresses me i am the definition of scum i shouldn t be depressed but i am i don t feel like i deserve to be depressed but i am and i hate myself even more because i am i hold a small grudge towards my parents for bringing me into this world i often find myself at night wishing they never met wishing i was never born the thought of me not existing brings me such joy but sadly i exist so the next best thing is death and i would of killed myself by now but the thought of pain stops me i m too scared death is the only thing i want in life and once again the only person stopping me is me i m my own worst enemy sometimes i wonder if that s why i wanna kill myself if somehow by committing suicide i have killed the person who s made me feel the way i feel i haven t told anyone the way i feel no friends or family i often joke to my friends about suicide but i m positive they think i m joking and have no idea how badly i want to die this one time my friend casually told me at a party that he was kind of depressed and he was describing exactly how i felt and what did i do i basically told him to shut up because no one wanted to hear that i don t know why i told him that i wonder if it was because he described my feelings and i felt like i couldn t accept it at the time i regret it everyday of my life it s another reason why i hate myself my friend didn t commit suicide and we ve hung out since then but he s never talked about it again and i haven t asked him i m not even good enough to be his friend i ve never felt connected to my family at least not enough to ever tell them my feelings i feel like my brothers and sisters were made for each other if that makes sense like when you learn that they re related you think yeah that makes sense but me not so much i m nothing like them we don t like the same things and our personalities are so different that when we get together like at a family gathering i find that i don t talk to them much and when we do they generally ask how s it going and i just say fine i ve felt so lonely my entire life ever since i was a child i ve never had a girlfriend and at this point i don t even want one because i m worried if i start dating someone and i tell her how i feel that she ll feel like she now has to stay in the relationship so i don t commit suicide i often day dream of hanging out with this chick i had a crush on in one of my high school classes we both love reggae music and we d listen to it in class every now and then i kind of gave signals that i was interested but she never did anything when i was attending community college she had the professor i had before me and we d talk for a few minutes the first couple times was just catching up cause we didn t see each other for a while and after that it was just me asking what we did in class now that i ve dropped out of college i still think about her i ve even had dreams about her where we were just hanging out i don t think that s healthy i think i love her but at the same time i just think i feel this way because i feel shitty but when i dream of her i don t hurt so bad but i m just her friend and i think i m ok with that but it still hurts because she ll never know how i feel but at the same time i know she doesn t feel the same at this point i feel like i m carrying a heavy weight and it just gets heavier and heavier but i keep carrying it and i want to drop it but somehow i put a smile on my face not because i m happy but because the thought of losing this weight makes me laugh and the thought of me killing myself makes me laugh because i know i ll carry it forever and i know i won t ever have the balls to kill myself so i feel i ll always feel this way but who knows to me death sounds good all the time so maybe when i m at my breaking point i ll do it i have a lot more to say but at this point i can t really think of a reason to keep going \n",

      " gt edit also if there is one thing i ve learned in life it s no matter how much you ask or scream for help nobody is going to come you re always going to be on your own you posted on this subreddit for a reason and from one depressed to another i want you to know this post can help you see that you truly aren t alone job and money is tricky our culture has esteemed the kind of job we have and the amount of money in our accounts to be the measures of success and this puts a ton of pressure to adhere to that standard to find self worth in this cruel life where not everyone starts on the same level it s scary because i don t have everything figured out still trying to search for my career and i have just enough to meek out a living with just enough to save and spend a little to have some fun and guess what i m   i have a bachelor s which amounted to no career and i m trying to get back into school for a different bachelor s with a much better job pool you re   and not to come off patronizing but there is plenty of time for you to keep searching and find your calling if money is an issue regarding school there is fafsa you can apply for assuming you re in the u s you can start building a solid credit score if you haven t already by opening a credit line and treating it as you would a debit card to spend what you can afford while paying off the debt in full you can work on getting certified or start community college to knock out general ed for much cheaper than you would at a uni if you haven t started school yet you can bite the bullet and work part time somewhere to start your collection of job experience or even consult a temp agency to get your foot in somewhere there are options and as i often say to others on this subreddit it all begins with small manageable steps parties are overrated especially if it s the kind of parties you think should be expected of from shows and movies and shit parties in general however can be pretty fun if you allow yourself to enjoy them you don t always need blowout parties and if getting access to them is the issue again start small try meetup com you can search based on your interests and hobbies and if you don t have much hobbies to speak of try picking up something simple and small it s daunting to meet new people believe me i know it took me years to develop extroverted habits and even then i m still an introvert at heart and need to recluse from social things to recharge my batteries it s disheartening to put yourself out there and deal with rejection but when it comes to social aspects in life it s what it takes and the more you expose yourself to it the less daunting it will seem because you give yourself the opportunities to learn from what did and didn t work and this most definitely applies to the dating world which leads to your health shape whatever label that goes on it check out r fitness get situated with the faqs and ask away if you have questions it s a very helpful subreddit and i refined my workout routines as a result of consulting there often the thing with fitness is it s difficult it s really tough to get started and it s a whole new battle to maintain it however once you start it only gets better from there it s so easy to sit down and look back to think if i only started __ years ago i d be so much more fit now but with fitness your best time to start is now it doesn t even have to start at the gym if money is an issue because weight loss comes from the kitchen if you re drinking   cans of soda a week cut it down to   a week then   then   then   then ween yourself from it and replace it with the occasional   juice if you re eating fast food   meals a day cut it down to   then   all the while making a trip or two to the market and avoid the aisles slowly replace a meal or snack with something you can simply whip up in the kitchen even just grilling chicken and stir frying your veggies is a big step up from ordering your usual from the take out joint gym wise i recommend planet fitness it s   a month to attend the gym you sign up at or   mo to gain access to any pf in the country there s a lot of circlejerk hatred for pf especially in r fitness because of the general lack of access to squat racks or deadlift stations and weights that cap out at like     pounds but if you re just starting out you don t need all that super heavy equipment and most of the people crying about pf aren t olympic lifters either so they re just joining in on the hate should you start going to the gym don t make the wild expectation that you re going to go every day every morning if it s not your routine yet start small try every two days every other day and once you get the hang of it you should add more gym days i m currently  lbs at     maybe at about     body fat not bad but considering i used to be   lbs and struggled with eating right and maintaining good exercising and eating habits over the past   years until now it s a milestone for me it doesn t have to take as long for you to get where you want to be but it all starts with you a healthy body image is important to building your confidence in many aspects but figuring out who you are and allowing yourself to embrace all that is actually good no matter how small is where it should begin you can look like adonis himself and still have poor self image so know that looks aren t as important as you being confident with who you are even with faults when you find the things you know you can work on whether it s eating habits or even something more abstract like having a hard time engaging people in conversation it s a lot easier to break down the issues into smaller realistic quest lines to complete before you know it you ll have completed a full arc for you to gain xp on the next one notice the trend here it s all about small steps my biggest tip to you is to work on yourself with manageable goals and give yourself time to let it all manifest into something greater than what you originally started with you working on yourself will steadily give you the confidence and capacity to love yourself more and until you love yourself you won t get yourself into a fulfilling position of someone else loving you back you can do this \n",

      "I was a generally sad child. But I don't feel like my problems stemmed from that. Years ago I decided that I wanted to join the army. It sounded like a good idea. Wrong. I'm not sure what it was that first triggered my major depression episodes, but it happened. I started falling apart. I had a rough experience. The army shuns the weak, both mental and physical. I'm strong but was still developing mentally at 18, still learning the world and who I was. Uncontrollable actions, such as fits of depression and anger made my life hell. The others picked up on it. I felt like they would rather leave me behind then help my up. I was right. I have one very vivid memory that I remember every day. I was laying in my bed (separated from the other beds in the middle of the room), with my two \"guards\" standing watch. Yeah, I had to have at least two people within arms reach of me at all times, even while sleeping. It got that bad. One of them decided he didn't have time for this. All I did was look at him and sigh. He took my pillow from under my head and tried to suffocate me. And I just laid there. Not moving. I didn't care. It didn't last long as the other people in the room (47 people) stepped in. After the event the drill sergeant walked in, unaware of the events that had transpired moments before. He walked up to me as I was laying in bed again. He bent over me and asked my how I was. I said that I was fine and he left. It has taken me a very long time to understand how I felt about this. Turns out I was angry at myself for failing something that I set out to do. I felt like garbage for so long. It took me 5 years to admit to myself that my self directed anger and loathing ment nothing. The past is the past. There is nothing that can be done about it. But my future, my happiness needs not be influenced by past failures. I was angry at myself, and I finally learned why. And I finally forgave myself.\n",

One thing that happens in school is that people are afraid to appear different, so if they have tastes that lie outside the mainstream, they may very well be afraid to express them.

I'm considering getting a candle or incense that I only burn when I'm working, since studies show that smell is closely tied to emotion.  \n",

Trust me, procrastinators are not lazy people. Fear of failure/success? Fear of change? Boredom? Indecisiveness? I'm procrastinating on a paper right now because the topic I chose turned out not to be as good as I originally thought, and I'm mad at myself for choosing a bad topic, and feeling hopeless about getting a good grade on it. Believe it or not, it's a relief to know that, because then I can do some positive self-talk and get over it and move forward. \n",

      "4. Do only one thing at a time.  When you're feeling really pressured it's easy to jump around from task to task -- you read the first two paragraphs of the text, do half a practice problem, review the first half of the first day's lecture notes -- but it's all very superficial. Instead, take some deep breaths, and set one reasonable goal and finish it.  I find it's better to do something that's more active than passive -- doing problems, recopying lecture notes, copying formulas over and over.  It helps with the jitters.   \n",
      "\n",
      "5. Manage distractions.  At work I use Toggl to track how much time I spend on various projects. When I get an e-mail, rather than jumping right into it, I take a second and decide whether I want to change my Toggl tracker, or keep going with my current project.  That tiny extra second means that I prioritize much better. And if I find I let myself drift into something else, I just refocus on the project at hand -- it's like meditating. Forgive yourself and move on. \n",

Anyways, in the article, it states: \"symptoms typically occur within a few days from drug discontinuation and last a few weeks\" which agrees with what I said about throwing your brain out of whack for a little while. The conclusion was that SSRIs can cause discontinuation problems which is true. That is not the same as causing depression. \n",
      "\n",
      "I don't know if you're able to see the article since most people can't unless they have a paid subscription or work in healthcare but it states later on in the article that the discontinuation symptoms were mostly caused in patients who discontinued abruptly. This also agrees with what I mentioned earlier about tapering off the medication. Yes, it's still possible to have side effects with tapering but far less likely. Additionally, we have to look at what they consider to be a symptom of \"discontinuation syndrome.\" In the article, it states things like fatigue, headache, diarrhea, etc. This is VERY different from discontinuation of SSRIs will cause depression. \n",
