    "# Text Analysis (Adapted from Garrent Gaut's 2016 Tutorial)\n",

    "## Introdution\n",
    "\n",
    "Text Analysis is great for summarizing or getting useful information out of a large amount of text stored in documents. This opens up the oppurtunity of using text data alongside more conventional data sources (e.g, surveys and administrative data). The goal of text analysis is to take a large corpus of complex and unstructured text data and extract important and meaningful messages in a comprehensible meaningful way. \n",
    "\n",
    "Text Analysis can help with the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Searches and informationa retrieval**: Help find relevant information in large databases such a systematic literature review. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Clustering and text categorization**: Techniques like clustering modeling can summarize a large corpus of text by finding the most important phrases. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Text Summarization**: Create category-sensitive text summaries of a large corpus of text. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Machine Translation**: Translate from one language to another. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Glossary of Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Tokenize**: Tokenization is the process by which text is sepearated into meaningful terms or phrases. Often separating sentences using punctuation. \n",
    "* **Stemming**: Stemming is a type of text normalization where words that have different forms but the essential meaning are normalized to the original dictionary form of a word. For example \"go,\" \"went,\" and \"goes\" all stem from the lemma \"go.\" \n",
    "* **TFIDF**: TFIDF (Term frequency-inverse document frequency) is an example of feature enginnering where the most important words are extracted by taking account their frequency in documents and the entire corpus of documents as a whole.\n",
    "* **Topic Modelling**: Topic modeling is an unsupervised learning method where the keywords that describe the topics in a large corpus of text are discovered. \n",
    "* **LDA**: LDA (latent Dirichlet allocation) is a type of topic modelling algorithm. \n",
    "* **Stop Words**: Stop words are words that have little semantic meaning like prepositions, articles and common nouns. \n",

And when the hurt is gone there is a big hole for a long time that can get filled up any number of ways. Some people fill it with anger - anger about a lot of things; their life, their ex, themselves. But anger only makes the hole bigger and deeper. Some people fill it with other things - sometimes good (family, friends, new relationships), sometimes not so good (one night stands, drugs, alcohol). But what really goes in that hole is you. You have to patch yourself back up with bits and pieces you find of yourself through some uncomfortable self-discovery. It takes a long time, and it hurts, but one day, without even realizing it's working, you'll look around and think, \"I feel whole again.\" And then your heart won't be broken and you'll have room inside for someone else.

      "&gt; In short I want to die. That's it really. I just want to stop living. Not because I'm depressed from sadness, but because I'm tired. I'm only 19 years old and I feel like I'm 80. In high school teachers, counselors, etc. always use to ask my peers and I where we saw ourselves in ten years. I never knew the answer. I still don't. I can't picture my life in 10 years, or 5 years, or even next year. I hope I'm dead. Earlier I said I'm not depressed. That's not entirely true. Let me explain. I don't want to do anything with my life. The thought of going to college and having a career saddens me. Even the thought of having a simple job saddens me. The thought of interacting with strangers frightens me. The thought of living saddens me. I'm scum. I have the possibility to do anything with my life, and I don't have a hard life. My parent's didn't hit me. They didn't divorce. I have wonderful brothers and sisters, and yet I still feel this way. If I had the opportunity to not exist and somehow give my position to somebody who has had a hard life and suffered to them I would because at least they'd do something with it. I'd do it in a heartbeat. This is what depresses me. I am the definition of scum. I shouldn't be depressed, but I am. I don't feel like I deserve to be depressed but I am. And I hate myself even more because I am. I hold a small grudge towards my parents for bringing me into this world. I often find myself at night wishing they never met. Wishing I was never born. The thought of me not existing brings me such joy. But sadly I exist so the next best thing is death. And I would of killed myself by now but the thought of pain stops me. I'm too scared. Death is the only thing I want in life and once again the only person stopping me is me. I'm my own worst enemy. Sometimes I wonder if that's why I wanna kill myself. If somehow by committing suicide, I have killed the person who's made me feel the way I feel. I haven't told anyone the way I feel. No friends or family. I often joke to my friends about suicide but I'm positive they think I'm joking and have no idea how badly I want to die. This one time my friend casually told me at a party that he was kind of depressed, and he was describing exactly how I felt, and what did I do? I basically told him to shut up because no one wanted to hear that. I don't know why I told him that. I wonder if it was because he described my feelings and I felt like I couldn't accept it at the time. I regret it everyday of my life. It's another reason why I hate myself. My friend didn't commit suicide, and we've hung out since then, but he's never talked about it again and I haven't asked him. I'm not even good enough to be his friend. I've never felt connected to my family. At least not enough to ever tell them my feelings. I feel like my brothers and sisters were made for each other, if that makes sense. Like when you learn that they're related you think \"yeah, that makes sense\" but me, not so much. I'm nothing like them. We don't like the same things, and our personalities are so different that when we get together, like at a family gathering, I find that I don't talk to them much. and when we do they generally ask how's it going and I just say \"fine\". I've felt so lonely my entire life. Ever since I was a child. I've never had a girlfriend and at this point I don't even want one because I'm worried if I start dating someone and I tell her how I feel that she'll feel like she now has to stay in the relationship so I don't commit suicide. I often day dream of hanging out with this chick I had a crush on in one of my high school classes. We both love reggae music and we'd listen to it in class every now and then. I kind of gave signals that I was interested, but she never did anything. When I was attending community college she had the professor I had before me, and we'd talk for a few minutes. The first couple times was just catching up cause we didn't see each other for a while, and after that it was just me asking what we did in class. Now that I've dropped out of college I still think about her. I've even had dreams about her where we were just hanging out. I don't think that's healthy. I think I love her, but at the same time I just think I feel this way because I feel shitty. But when I dream of her I don't hurt so bad. But I'm just her friend, and I think I'm ok with that but it still hurts because she'll never know how I feel, but at the same time I know she doesn't feel the same. At this point I feel like I'm carrying a heavy weight and it just gets heavier and heavier. But I keep carrying it, and I want to drop it. But somehow I put a smile on my face, not because I'm happy but because the thought of losing this weight makes me laugh and the thought of me killing myself makes me laugh, because I know I'll carry it forever and I know I won't ever have the balls to kill myself, so I feel I'll always feel this way, but who knows. To me death sounds good all the time so maybe when I'm at my breaking point I'll do it. I have a lot more to say, but at this point I can't really think of a reason to keep going.\n",

I also recall reading about something called \"the rule of thirds\": this refers to how in clinical studies for a particular antidepressant, the pattern tends to be that 1/3 of patients will go into partial remission (i.e., they are almost completely better but have residual symptoms), 1/3 will go into full remission, and 1/3 will not show any response.\n",
